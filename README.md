# TellMeYourFriend

This is my first project uploaded to my GitHub repository, and I would like to mention that I have been learning the Swift programming language for only a few weeks. The project's name is "TellMeYourFriend," and it is an application for storing information about friends or acquaintances. You can save the person's photo, name, occupation or department, age, and closeness level. I'm sure Leonard Shelby, the main character in Christopher Nolan's movie "Memento," would have been thrilled if he had known about this application.

## Project Details

The project consists of two screens. The first screen contains a table view, and the second screen contains an image view, four text fields, and a button. By tapping the plus button in the top-right corner of the first screen, you can navigate to the second screen.

On the second screen, you can tap on the image view to select a photo from the gallery. The save button remains inactive until you select a photo. Once you have filled in the information and saved it, the application returns to the main screen. You can view the saved person's name on the main screen.

By tapping on the person's name, you can navigate to the second screen again, where the person's photo and information will be displayed, without the save button this time. You can go back to the main screen and delete the person you saved using the back button.

## Installation

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for inspiring me with his movie "Memento" and motivating me to create this application.
